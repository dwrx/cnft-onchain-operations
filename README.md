# Example how to mint and burn cNFTs from an on-chain contract

This contract needs to be built on Devnet/Mainnet as there is the dependency on the Bubblegum contract.

To run the tests you need to create a collection and a tree first and fill the appropriate constants in `./tests/nft-program.ts`

This is a draft, any improvements are welcome.
