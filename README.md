This repo is a work in progress.

The contract needs to be built on Devnet/Mainnet as there is the dependency on the Bubblegum contract.

To run the tests you need to create a tree first and fill the appropriate constants in `./tests/nft-program.ts`

This is an example, any improvements are welcome.
